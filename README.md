# snippetify ðŸŽ¨
snippetify is a productivity and research tool in the form of a minimalistic chrome browser extension that lets you highlight text on webpages with pastel colored highlighters and locally save snippets of exactly what you highlighted with links for future reference. 

## use case
in the situation when you're researching something on the web and find that only a few lines on a webpage helpful, instead of having to copy-paste that link as reference manually into your notes document, this extension allows you to highlight that piece of text on the website itself and save the snippet. 

## how it works + features
the portion you highlighted automatically gets saved locally so when you open up the extension preview, you can find a cumulative list of the things you've highlighted using that browser along with a hyperlink back to its original websites. some notable features:
- sleek interface + nice minimalistic ui (with a ton of whitespace) + multi pastel highlighter colors.
- the highlighted portion doesn't get erased if you refresh and if you reopen the website at a later date. it's so that you can quickly identify the portion you need to refer to at a glance. 
- in the list of saved notes, you can also edit the 'heading' of each individual snippet to describe it in your own words so that when you reopen the list at some other time, you can quickly navigate and brush up on what each snippet contains instead of having to open the individual websites.

## how to use
the extension is lightweight and super easy to use:
- <b>step one:</b> the extension can be added to your chromium browser from the [chrome web store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/snippetify/eigemfhjhgieeiikiamkoplbpibncadh)
